## Overview

WhatToWear is a full-stack application that helps users decide what to wear each day by combining live weather data and a personal wardrobe inventory. The backend (Express) aggregates weather feeds, manages user wardrobes, and returns outfit suggestions. The frontend (React/Vite) provides an intuitive UI for managing clothing items, viewing daily suggestions, and saving favorites.

## Key Features

- **Weather-Aware Recommendations**: Fetches local weather (temperature, precipitation, wind) and recommends outfits suitable for current conditions and forecasts.
- **Wardrobe Inventory**: Users upload or create clothing items with attributes (type, layers, warmth, colors, images). Items are stored in the user profile and can be tagged.
- **Outfit Builder & History**: Saved outfit combinations and history let users reuse looks and refine recommendations over time.
- **Lightweight API Layer**: Server aggregates third-party weather APIs, normalizes responses, and applies caching to limit external calls.
- **Dockerized & CI/CD Ready**: Containerized backend and frontend with GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployment.

## Technologies Used

- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Frontend: React (Vite)
- External APIs: OpenWeatherMap (or alternate provider)
- Data Storage: MongoDB (Mongoose) for users and wardrobe
- Caching: Redis or in-memory TTL cache for weather and recommendation results
- Auth: JWT for session handling and protected user resources
- Deployment: Google Cloud, optional Nginx reverse proxy + Certbot for SSL
- Utilities: multer / cloud storage for item images, axios for HTTP, cron jobs for scheduled syncs

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Data Modeling for Clothing**: Designing a flexible schema for clothing attributes (layering, warmth, formality, color) was key to meaningful recommendations.
- **Normalization of External Data**: Weather providers use different structures; an adapter layer simplifies downstream logic.
- **Caching & Rate Limits**: Implemented short TTLs and request coalescing to avoid exceeding external API rate limits while keeping suggestions fresh.
- **Image Handling**: Optimizing upload, storage, and delivery of item photos improved UX and reduced bandwidth.



## Outcome

- A coherent MVP that suggests context-appropriate outfits, enables wardrobe management, and integrates with external data sources.
- Backend endpoints for wardrobe CRUD, suggestion generation, and user preferences are available and ready for frontend consumption.
- The system is containerized and prepared for deployment; frontend can run as a static site while the API runs in a Docker container on a VM.
- **Domain**: https://wtwrkedycat.baselinux.net
- **Frontend repo**: https://github.com/kedycatsudo/se_project_react

## Deployment & Next Steps

1. Point a domain or free DNS to your VM and create an A record for the API host.
2. Use Nginx as a reverse proxy and obtain SSL certificates via Certbot to enable HTTPS.
3. Harden the VM (SSH keys, disable root login, enable UFW for 22/80/443).
4. Store API keys and secrets in CI/CD secrets or a secrets manager; use environment variables at runtime.
5. Add Redis for stable caching if scaling, and enable structured logging and monitoring.
6. Improve personalization with lightweight ML models or heuristics, add image auto-tagging (color, type), and implement offline-first frontend caching for reliability.
7. Offer social sharing and exportable outfit plans as future features.

## Confessions of a Code-First Creator (Who Isn't a Designer)

It might sound strange, but for me, putting creativity on digital paper—whether it's designing a website, painting, or drawing—has always been a struggle. Which is odd, because I consider myself a very creative person. That creativity shows up in all sorts of places: problem-solving software, coming up with clever workflows, or even my work as a sous chef, plating a dish. But something about UI/UX design? It just doesn't come naturally.

I don’t have formal design training or a background in art, and I suspect that’s part of the reason why it’s tough for me to know what will actually look good on a website. Still, I definitely see improvement every time I work on a new project, and that’s what matters. Progress, not perfection!


### Login & Register: Stealing with Pride

<img src="/newPortfolio/images/gallery/loginregister.png" alt="Login/Register Logo" />

When it came time to design the login and registration screens, I realized I didn’t need to look any further than my own past work. I borrowed heavily from the layouts and user flows I’d built for MealMatch—there’s no shame in reusing your own tried-and-true solutions! It made the whole process much faster and let me focus on refining the user experience instead of reinventing basic forms.

I tweaked the color scheme and spacing to fit the MyFinance brand, but many components—like labeled input fields, feedback messages, and the clean, central card layout—came straight from my previous designs. Adapting what worked well in MealMatch gave me a solid foundation and a little boost of confidence, too. Sometimes the smartest move is to steal from yourself.

---

### Dashboard: Where It Starts Feeling Real

<img src="/newPortfolio/images/gallery/dashboard.png" alt="Login/Register Logo" />


After a couple hours of sketching and tweaking, I had my Dashboard page laid out and surprisingly… I liked the result! Here's the setup:

- Logo stays anchored in the top left—because hey, brand consistency matters!
- Page header reminds you where you are.
- Welcoming message with a splash of color ("Welcome to MyFinance Dashboard. Congratulations, your colour is green so far this month!")—it's a tiny touch, but helps users feel seen and in control.

On the left, a sidebar for navigation. The main area holds three bubble containers with key data stats and listings. I chose a palette of crisp white with soft, light blue accents for the background. It adds clarity and clear separation without straining the eyes, even for longer reading or data review sessions.

I plan to use these bubbles throughout the app—consistency makes life easier, and creating reusable components isn’t just smart for devs, it’s a win for design too.


---

### The Pie Chart Challenge

Of course, it's not all smooth sailing. Building a pie chart that visually breaks down the data by category, with colors that mean something and look good, is going to be a real challenge—especially as a code-first person. But I'm up for it. Backend-to-frontend data connection will push me a bit outside my comfort zone, but that's the part that excites me most.

---

### What I've Learned So Far

- Not being a designer doesn’t mean you can’t design—just expect to iterate more.
- Borrowing trusted layouts and patterns is totally okay, especially for forms.
- Pick a color scheme you love early on, and use it as much as possible. Your app will feel more cohesive.
- Reusable components save you headaches down the line.
- Tackling the hardest parts (architecture and data flow) before visuals makes UI decisions easier.

---

### Next Steps

There’s still plenty to build: sidebar sections, adding more data containers, and thinking through the rest of the workflow screens. But with the dashboard and auth pages done, things are starting to click into place. 

After these steps, I’ll finally be able to start writing some code and wiring up the real data. That’s the fun part I’ve been waiting for!

---

### Parting Thoughts

Design is always going to challenge me, but that's half the reason I wanted to build MyFinance in the first place—creating something that solves a problem I care about, and learning new tech skills in the process. Each step, even the awkward, uncertain design moments, is progress. If you want to follow along with the build, or have advice on making pie charts prettier, I’d love to hear from you!

Thanks for reading—and have an awesome day!

## Why Build MyFinance?

A couple weeks ago, after launching my new portfolio website, I shared that I’d be starting a project that genuinely excites me. This is it: MyFinance.

Why am I so hyped about this one? Because for the first time, I’m building a solution for a real-world problem that I actually face every month. I’ve tried a bunch of finance apps, but most are either paid, overloaded with features I don’t need, or simply don’t fit the way I want to track things. I wanted something simple: to track my monthly income and expenses and keep my investments tidy—all in one dashboard. 

So, I decided to build my own tailored solution. And yes, MyFinance will be completely free!

---

## Defining the Project Scope & Goals

**Project name:** MyFinance

**The goal:** Let users (including myself!) easily track income, expenses, and investments with custom categories, see profit or loss each month, and export statements as neat PDFs.

**MVP Features:**  
- Personal sign up & login for privacy  
- Default and custom categories for income/expenses  
- Add/edit income and expense entries  
- Track investments (profit/loss per asset)  
- Monthly summary & one-click PDF exports

**Out of scope (for now):**  
- Bank integrations  
- Cross-account transfers  
- Net worth tracking  
- Mobile app  
- Payments/subscriptions

---

## Planning Data Flow & Architecture

I spent a fair bit of time sketching out the data models and relationships before writing any code. Here’s what I decided on:

**Core entities:**  
- **User:** Your personal account and settings  
- **Category:** "Groceries", "Salary", etc.—for grouping transactions  
- **Transaction:** Any income or expense entry  
- **Investment:** Profit/loss for assets you hold  
- **MonthlySnapshot (optional):** For caching monthly summaries

**Example data models:**

```json
// User
{ "username": "kedycat", "currency": "USD" }

// Category
{ "title": "Groceries", "type": "expense" }

// Transaction
{ "categoryId": "...", "type": "expense", "amount": 380000, "date": "..." }

// Investment
{ "asset": "BTC", "resultType": "profit", "resultAmount": 5000 }
```

- Transactions are linked to categories (many-to-one)
- Investments linked to users

---

## Aggregation & Reporting

One of the things I wanted most was a clear, one-glance monthly report showing income, expenses, investments, and overall profit.

I’m leveraging MongoDB’s aggregation to crunch the numbers for monthly reports:

- Sum up monthly income and expenses
- Sum profits (or losses) from investments
- Compute overall profit:

`profit = incomeTotal + investmentTotal - expenseTotal`

**API sample response:**

```json
{
  "incomeTotal": 450000,
  "expenseTotal": 350000,
  "investmentTotal": 50000,
  "profit": 150000
}
```

---

## API & UI Design

To keep things neat and user-friendly:

- **API Endpoints:** signup/login, CRUD for categories, transactions, investments, monthly reporting with PDF export
- **UI:** A dashboard with charts, easy category management, quick data entry via modals, and one-click PDF downloads

---

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (React UI & API routes)
- **TypeScript**
- **MongoDB**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- PDF export support via **Puppeteer** (or another server-side PDF lib)

---

## What’s Next?

Development has begun, and I’ll be sharing updates on how the build goes, and posting project learnings, cool solutions, and perhaps even some pain points here in the blog. If tracking your finances in your own way sounds interesting, stay tuned!

Thanks for reading—and wish me luck building MyFinance!
