## Overview

WhatToWear is a full-stack application that helps users decide what to wear each day by combining live weather data, a personal wardrobe inventory, calendar events, and user style preferences. The backend (Express) aggregates weather and calendar feeds, manages user wardrobes and preferences, and returns ranked outfit suggestions. The frontend (React/Vite) provides an intuitive UI for managing clothing items, viewing daily suggestions, and saving favorites.

## Key Features

- **Weather-Aware Recommendations**: Fetches local weather (temperature, precipitation, wind) and recommends outfits suitable for current conditions and forecasts.
- **Wardrobe Inventory**: Users upload or create clothing items with attributes (type, layers, warmth, colors, images). Items are stored in the user profile and can be tagged.
- **Event & Calendar Integration**: Optionally syncs with user calendars to tailor outfit suggestions to event type (formal, casual, outdoor) and time of day.
- **Personalization & Preferences**: Users set style preferences, disliked items, and preferred outfits; the system learns and ranks suggestions accordingly.
- **Outfit Builder & History**: Saved outfit combinations and history let users reuse looks and refine recommendations over time.
- **Smart Filters & Constraints**: Supports constraints like dress code, color coordination, and laundry status.
- **Lightweight API Layer**: Server aggregates third-party weather APIs, normalizes responses, and applies caching to limit external calls.
- **Dockerized & CI/CD Ready**: Containerized backend and frontend with GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployment.

## Technologies Used

- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Frontend: React (Vite)
- External APIs: OpenWeatherMap (or alternate provider), Google Calendar / CalDAV adapters
- Data Storage: MongoDB (Mongoose) for users, wardrobe, and preferences
- Caching: Redis or in-memory TTL cache for weather and recommendation results
- Auth: JWT for session handling and protected user resources
- Deployment: Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), optional Nginx reverse proxy + Certbot for SSL
- Utilities: multer / cloud storage for item images, axios for HTTP, cron jobs for scheduled syncs

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Data Modeling for Clothing**: Designing a flexible schema for clothing attributes (layering, warmth, formality, color) was key to meaningful recommendations.
- **Normalization of External Data**: Weather and calendar providers use different structures; an adapter layer simplifies downstream logic.
- **Personalization**: Balancing automated recommendations with user control required clear preference settings and feedback loops (likes/dislikes).
- **Caching & Rate Limits**: Implemented short TTLs and request coalescing to avoid exceeding external API rate limits while keeping suggestions fresh.
- **Image Handling**: Optimizing upload, storage, and delivery of item photos improved UX and reduced bandwidth.

## Outcome

- A coherent MVP that suggests context-appropriate outfits, enables wardrobe management, and integrates with external data sources.
- Backend endpoints for wardrobe CRUD, suggestion generation, calendar sync, and user preferences are available and ready for frontend consumption.
- The system is containerized and prepared for deployment; frontend can run as a static site while the API runs in a Docker container on a VM.

## Deployment & Next Steps

1. Point a domain or free DNS to your VM and create an A record for the API host.
2. Use Nginx as a reverse proxy and obtain SSL certificates via Certbot to enable HTTPS.
3. Harden the VM (SSH keys, disable root login, enable UFW for 22/80/443).
4. Store API keys and secrets in CI/CD secrets or a secrets manager; use environment variables at runtime.
5. Add Redis for stable caching if scaling, and enable structured logging and monitoring.
6. Improve personalization with lightweight ML models or heuristics, add image auto-tagging (color, type), and implement offline-first frontend caching for reliability.
7. Offer social sharing and exportable outfit plans as future features.

## About

Welcome to my new portfolio! I built this site using the Magic Portfolio template by Once UI, powered by Next.js. It’s MDX-based, SEO-friendly, responsive for any screen, and easily customizable.

I wanted a platform to showcase my work, projects, and blog posts — and I found this setup perfect for developers who want both flexibility and polish.

## Why I Chose This Stack

I wanted to learn a new framework not just by following tutorials, but by diving in and building something real from scratch. Hands-on experience always helps me understand and retain new skills better.

After some research, I picked these tools for my portfolio:

- **Next.js** — a modern React framework that makes routing, deployment, and performance optimization much easier out of the box.
- **MDX** — lets me write content in Markdown while also embedding React components, so my blog can be interactive and developer-friendly.
- **Once UI / Magic Portfolio** — provides a beautiful, ready-to-go theme with professional design, so I can focus my time on learning and content rather than building a design system from scratch.

## Quick Start

Thinking of starting your own? Here’s how I did it:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "git clone https://github.com/once-ui-system/magic-portfolio.git",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

Install the dependencies:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "npm install",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

Start your local dev server:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "npm run dev",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

## What’s Next?

I’ll be sharing more about my journey, tech experiments, and projects here. Stay tuned for posts on web development, the MERN stack, and full-stack best practices!
