## Overview

WhatToWear is a full-stack application that helps users decide what to wear each day by combining live weather data and a personal wardrobe inventory. The backend (Express) aggregates weather feeds, manages user wardrobes, and returns outfit suggestions. The frontend (React/Vite) provides an intuitive UI for managing clothing items, viewing daily suggestions, and saving favorites.

## Key Features

- **Weather-Aware Recommendations**: Fetches local weather (temperature, precipitation, wind) and recommends outfits suitable for current conditions and forecasts.
- **Wardrobe Inventory**: Users upload or create clothing items with attributes (type, layers, warmth, colors, images). Items are stored in the user profile and can be tagged.
- **Outfit Builder & History**: Saved outfit combinations and history let users reuse looks and refine recommendations over time.
- **Lightweight API Layer**: Server aggregates third-party weather APIs, normalizes responses, and applies caching to limit external calls.
- **Dockerized & CI/CD Ready**: Containerized backend and frontend with GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployment.

## Technologies Used

- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Frontend: React (Vite)
- External APIs: OpenWeatherMap (or alternate provider)
- Data Storage: MongoDB (Mongoose) for users and wardrobe
- Caching: Redis or in-memory TTL cache for weather and recommendation results
- Auth: JWT for session handling and protected user resources
- Deployment: Google Cloud, optional Nginx reverse proxy + Certbot for SSL
- Utilities: multer / cloud storage for item images, axios for HTTP, cron jobs for scheduled syncs

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Data Modeling for Clothing**: Designing a flexible schema for clothing attributes (layering, warmth, formality, color) was key to meaningful recommendations.
- **Normalization of External Data**: Weather providers use different structures; an adapter layer simplifies downstream logic.
- **Caching & Rate Limits**: Implemented short TTLs and request coalescing to avoid exceeding external API rate limits while keeping suggestions fresh.
- **Image Handling**: Optimizing upload, storage, and delivery of item photos improved UX and reduced bandwidth.



## Outcome

- A coherent MVP that suggests context-appropriate outfits, enables wardrobe management, and integrates with external data sources.
- Backend endpoints for wardrobe CRUD, suggestion generation, and user preferences are available and ready for frontend consumption.
- The system is containerized and prepared for deployment; frontend can run as a static site while the API runs in a Docker container on a VM.
- **Domain**: https://wtwrkedycat.baselinux.net
- **Frontend repo**: https://github.com/kedycatsudo/se_project_react

## Deployment & Next Steps

1. Point a domain or free DNS to your VM and create an A record for the API host.
2. Use Nginx as a reverse proxy and obtain SSL certificates via Certbot to enable HTTPS.
3. Harden the VM (SSH keys, disable root login, enable UFW for 22/80/443).
4. Store API keys and secrets in CI/CD secrets or a secrets manager; use environment variables at runtime.
5. Add Redis for stable caching if scaling, and enable structured logging and monitoring.
6. Improve personalization with lightweight ML models or heuristics, add image auto-tagging (color, type), and implement offline-first frontend caching for reliability.
7. Offer social sharing and exportable outfit plans as future features.

## 🚀 Diving Deeper into Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL!

Just wrapped up building the first interactive pages for my web app, **MyFinance**, and I have to say—I'm blown away by the development speed Next.js offers. Coming from zero experience with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL, I expected the learning curve would slow me down. 

It turns out, the process is much smoother than I imagined. Within days, I went from blank screens to a snappy login and register system, all responsive and matching my design vision.

![MyFinance Logo](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/login.png)

### 🌐 Designing with Reusable Components

Designing clean, responsive UIs with Tailwind CSS felt intimidating at first (not a design fan here 😅), but seeing everything come together on both desktop and mobile made it worth the effort. 

What surprised me most was how easy it was to maintain consistency across the project once I set up my first truly responsive page and a few reusable components. After that, adapting the look and structure for other pages became almost effortless—no more rewriting the same CSS or re tweaking layouts! 

Every element—buttons, inputs, containers—was built once and used everywhere, letting me focus on the bigger picture: how users will flow through the app and how data will move under the hood.

### ⚡ The Magic of Next.js Routing

Setting up the `/app` directory in Next.js made routing a breeze—no manual setup required! As someone who’s used to wiring up traditional routers and view logic by hand, it felt almost unreal to just drop a new file or folder into `/app` and have a working new route. 

Now, with the frontend for login and registration pages in place and polished, I’m really looking forward to diving deeper into server side coding. I can't wait to explore things like authentication flows, data fetching with React Server Components, API routes, and real database connections.

Honestly, the pace of development is way beyond what I expected going in. No wonder Next.js has become the go to for so many modern web apps!

### ✨ Surprises & Learnings So Far

- **Tailwind CSS isn’t just “another CSS framework”**: It made responsive design feel natural, not like an afterthought. I used to dread making layouts mobile friendly—now, I build with breakpoints from the start.
- **Component driven design really pays off**: Once you have a toolbox of fields, forms, and containers, everything new is just composition.
- **VSCode is my friend again**: I spend less time fighting with boilerplate and more time thinking about real features. 
- **Frontend Backend are more connected than I thought**: Choices in form design and page structure are already shaping what data I’ll need and how I’ll store it.

![MyFinance Logo](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/register.png)


### 🛤️ What’s Next?

With the core structure and authentication pages (login, register) done, my next step is to round out the rest of MyFinance’s main interface. I’ll be focusing on finishing up the frontends for the other essential pages: **dashboard, incomes, outcomes, investment, and profile**.

I'm confident that building out these screens—from data tables to interactive components—will challenge me and deepen my skills in Tailwind CSS and the frontend capabilities of Next.js. Each new page is an opportunity to refine my design system, improve maintainability, and ensure consistency across the application.

Once the UI is complete, I get to dive into my favorite part: the backend! I can't wait to architect relational flows, design efficient schemas, and bring MyFinance’s data to life using PostgreSQL and Next.js server-side features. 

I’ll be posting regular updates and sharing everything I learn—mistakes included—so if you're interested in a transparent build process or want insights on working with these technologies, stay tuned!

Stay warm, and let’s keep building awesome things!

## Frontend Design Wrapped 🎉 — MyFinance Dev Update

I can hardly believe it’s only been 12 days since I started building MyFinance. (To be honest, it felt even longer for how much I processed in those days. The result? I really like where it landed MyFinance holds way more information and complexity compared to MealMatch, and I’ll get into why!)

### Starting with System Design

Before touching Figma, I mapped out backend schemas, data tables, data flows… basically all the structure from the ground up. As I moved into frontend design, some of those choices needed realignment—which just proves how closely backend and frontend play together. That’s what makes me proud to call myself a full stack developer now; I enjoy shaping both and seeing how each informs the other. Watching the logic (“bones”) and the interface (“skin”) come together, evolving in sync, is deeply satisfying—especially when it all just starts to make sense for this app’s unique needs.

### The Evolution (What I Had vs. What I Changed)

Page by page, my design instincts grew. I kept asking myself: what do I really need to see (not just what would be “cool”)? I focused on showing crisp separations between information blocks—this is a data-driven app, after all, with not much imagery or fluff. Each block needed clear segmenting, so data is readable (and, dare I say, a little inviting?). By the final screen, I noticed I’d developed a consistent style for lists, inputs, and modals—so I looped back and updated the earlier pages for a unified MVP look.

---

### The Finished Design (So Far)

Here’s the current lineup of 5 main pages (and what changed):

- **Login/Register**  
  Totally refreshed with new input styles and containers. These now fit the background narrative and feel much more futuristic—so good, they’re almost “fun” to fill out!
  
  ![Login/Register](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/loginregister.png)

- **Dashboard**  
  Updated data blocks with my current design language. I plopped in new "side" blocks that display investments and miscellaneous spending for the current month—turns out, these were just what the page needed. Recent incomings and outgoings show up in up-to-date tables.
  
  ![Dashboard](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/dashboard.png)

- **Incomes/Outcomes**  
  These pages are basically the birthplace of the new style. At first, the content was there, but it looked bland. With a new component system and better background, both pages are way cleaner and actually nice to look at, no matter how much data you throw at them.  
  ![Income/Outcome](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/incomesoutcomes.png)

- **Investment**  
  Here’s where things got really interesting. There’s a LOT more relevant data to surface than I first thought—assets, profit/loss, types, and more. I intentionally kept the scope tight so I wouldn’t overbuild, but re-used small components for new types of info. It’s also where I realized the importance of relational data: investments link to assets, returns, and user activity in ways a pure document database can’t easily handle. I started out building with MongoDB, but the deeper I went, the clearer it became—this project’s structure begs for a relational database. I’m now researching my options:  
    - **PostgreSQL:** Handles relationships, powerful queries, open source, huge community.  
    - **MySQL:** Mature, widespread, great performance, but not as flexible for JSON or modern types.  
    - **Supabase:** Postgres-based with instant APIs/auth, but still a bit new for mission-critical stuff.  

  I haven’t picked one yet, but diving into relational DBs makes this project even more valuable for me—I’m learning Next.js and TypeScript, then adding serious SQL design to my stack!

- **Profile**  
  The simplest page, showing only what I need from the user: username, email (for auth/comms), the reset date for their monthly statement, and base currency for future features.

---

- **Modals for Editing Data:**  
  There’s one main modal for editing, but it’s super reusable—swapping content as needed from page to page, styled for clarity and easy option selection or confirmation.

- **A Bunch of Small, Reusable Components:**  
  Core to keeping things DRY and maintainable.  
  ![Components](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/component.png)

- **Custom Buttons and Input Fields:**  
  Unified style, with color feedback and clear affordances everywhere.

---

In all honesty, designing for the large screen is now DONE—the structure is locked in, and every part fits just right. All that’s left is implementation, testing, and deployment. It feels wild to write that!

---

### What’s Next?

Much as I’d love to skip it, there’s no shipping a web app in 2025 that isn’t responsive. So mobile-first and tablet designs are next on my list. Once that's in place, I can finally dive deep into the codebase, start plugging in data, and let the real logic shine. I’m actually looking forward to untangling backend aggregates and complex queries with my new relational DB setup!

---

Thanks so much for following along—every message and bit of feedback motivates me more! Stay tuned for mobile layouts and backend tales soon, and as always, I’d love to hear your thoughts or suggestions.

Stay warm, happy holidays, and keep building! 🚀
