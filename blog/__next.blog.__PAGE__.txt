## 🚀 Diving Deeper into Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL!

Just wrapped up building the first interactive pages for my web app, **MyFinance**, and I have to say—I'm blown away by the development speed Next.js offers. Coming from zero experience with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL, I expected the learning curve would slow me down. 

It turns out, the process is much smoother than I imagined. Within days, I went from blank screens to a snappy login and register system, all responsive and matching my design vision.

![MyFinance Logo](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/login.png)

### 🌐 Designing with Reusable Components

Designing clean, responsive UIs with Tailwind CSS felt intimidating at first (not a design fan here 😅), but seeing everything come together on both desktop and mobile made it worth the effort. 

What surprised me most was how easy it was to maintain consistency across the project once I set up my first truly responsive page and a few reusable components. After that, adapting the look and structure for other pages became almost effortless—no more rewriting the same CSS or re tweaking layouts! 

Every element—buttons, inputs, containers—was built once and used everywhere, letting me focus on the bigger picture: how users will flow through the app and how data will move under the hood.

### ⚡ The Magic of Next.js Routing

Setting up the `/app` directory in Next.js made routing a breeze—no manual setup required! As someone who’s used to wiring up traditional routers and view logic by hand, it felt almost unreal to just drop a new file or folder into `/app` and have a working new route. 

Now, with the frontend for login and registration pages in place and polished, I’m really looking forward to diving deeper into server side coding. I can't wait to explore things like authentication flows, data fetching with React Server Components, API routes, and real database connections.

Honestly, the pace of development is way beyond what I expected going in. No wonder Next.js has become the go to for so many modern web apps!

### ✨ Surprises & Learnings So Far

- **Tailwind CSS isn’t just “another CSS framework”**: It made responsive design feel natural, not like an afterthought. I used to dread making layouts mobile friendly—now, I build with breakpoints from the start.
- **Component driven design really pays off**: Once you have a toolbox of fields, forms, and containers, everything new is just composition.
- **VSCode is my friend again**: I spend less time fighting with boilerplate and more time thinking about real features. 
- **Frontend Backend are more connected than I thought**: Choices in form design and page structure are already shaping what data I’ll need and how I’ll store it.

![MyFinance Logo](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/register.png)


### 🛤️ What’s Next?

With the core structure and authentication pages (login, register) done, my next step is to round out the rest of MyFinance’s main interface. I’ll be focusing on finishing up the frontends for the other essential pages: **dashboard, incomes, outcomes, investment, and profile**.

I'm confident that building out these screens—from data tables to interactive components—will challenge me and deepen my skills in Tailwind CSS and the frontend capabilities of Next.js. Each new page is an opportunity to refine my design system, improve maintainability, and ensure consistency across the application.

Once the UI is complete, I get to dive into my favorite part: the backend! I can't wait to architect relational flows, design efficient schemas, and bring MyFinance’s data to life using PostgreSQL and Next.js server-side features. 

I’ll be posting regular updates and sharing everything I learn—mistakes included—so if you're interested in a transparent build process or want insights on working with these technologies, stay tuned!

Stay warm, and let’s keep building awesome things!

## Frontend Design Wrapped 🎉 — MyFinance Dev Update

I can hardly believe it’s only been 12 days since I started building MyFinance. (To be honest, it felt even longer for how much I processed in those days. The result? I really like where it landed MyFinance holds way more information and complexity compared to MealMatch, and I’ll get into why!)

![MyFinance Logo](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/myfinancelogo.png)

---

### Starting with System Design

Before touching Figma, I mapped out backend schemas, data tables, data flows… basically all the structure from the ground up. As I moved into frontend design, some of those choices needed realignment—which just proves how closely backend and frontend play together. That’s what makes me proud to call myself a full stack developer now; I enjoy shaping both and seeing how each informs the other. Watching the logic (“bones”) and the interface (“skin”) come together, evolving in sync, is deeply satisfying—especially when it all just starts to make sense for this app’s unique needs.

![Puzzle Logo](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/puzzle.jpg)

---

### The Evolution (What I Had vs. What I Changed)

Page by page, my design instincts grew. I kept asking myself: what do I really need to see (not just what would be “cool”)? I focused on showing crisp separations between information blocks—this is a data-driven app, after all, with not much imagery or fluff. Each block needed clear segmenting, so data is readable (and, dare I say, a little inviting?). By the final screen, I noticed I’d developed a consistent style for lists, inputs, and modals—so I looped back and updated the earlier pages for a unified MVP look.

---

### The Finished Design (So Far)

Here’s the current lineup of 5 main pages (and what changed):

- **Login/Register**  
  Totally refreshed with new input styles and containers. These now fit the background narrative and feel much more futuristic—so good, they’re almost “fun” to fill out!
  
  ![Login/Register](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/loginregister.png)

- **Dashboard**  
  Updated data blocks with my current design language. I plopped in new "side" blocks that display investments and miscellaneous spending for the current month—turns out, these were just what the page needed. Recent incomings and outgoings show up in up-to-date tables.
  
  ![Dashboard](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/dashboard.png)

- **Incomes/Outcomes**  
  These pages are basically the birthplace of the new style. At first, the content was there, but it looked bland. With a new component system and better background, both pages are way cleaner and actually nice to look at, no matter how much data you throw at them.  
  ![Income/Outcome](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/incomesoutcomes.png)

- **Investment**  
  Here’s where things got really interesting. There’s a LOT more relevant data to surface than I first thought—assets, profit/loss, types, and more. I intentionally kept the scope tight so I wouldn’t overbuild, but re-used small components for new types of info. It’s also where I realized the importance of relational data: investments link to assets, returns, and user activity in ways a pure document database can’t easily handle. I started out building with MongoDB, but the deeper I went, the clearer it became—this project’s structure begs for a relational database. I’m now researching my options:  
    - **PostgreSQL:** Handles relationships, powerful queries, open source, huge community.  
    - **MySQL:** Mature, widespread, great performance, but not as flexible for JSON or modern types.  
    - **Supabase:** Postgres-based with instant APIs/auth, but still a bit new for mission-critical stuff.  

  I haven’t picked one yet, but diving into relational DBs makes this project even more valuable for me—I’m learning Next.js and TypeScript, then adding serious SQL design to my stack!

  ![Investment](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/investment.png)

- **Profile**  
  The simplest page, showing only what I need from the user: username, email (for auth/comms), the reset date for their monthly statement, and base currency for future features.

  ![Profile](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/profile.png)

---

- **Modals for Editing Data:**  
  There’s one main modal for editing, but it’s super reusable—swapping content as needed from page to page, styled for clarity and easy option selection or confirmation.

- **A Bunch of Small, Reusable Components:**  
  Core to keeping things DRY and maintainable.  
  ![Components](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/component.png)

- **Custom Buttons and Input Fields:**  
  Unified style, with color feedback and clear affordances everywhere.

---

In all honesty, designing for the large screen is now DONE—the structure is locked in, and every part fits just right. All that’s left is implementation, testing, and deployment. It feels wild to write that!

---

### What’s Next?

Much as I’d love to skip it, there’s no shipping a web app in 2025 that isn’t responsive. So mobile-first and tablet designs are next on my list. Once that's in place, I can finally dive deep into the codebase, start plugging in data, and let the real logic shine. I’m actually looking forward to untangling backend aggregates and complex queries with my new relational DB setup!

---

Thanks so much for following along—every message and bit of feedback motivates me more! Stay tuned for mobile layouts and backend tales soon, and as always, I’d love to hear your thoughts or suggestions.

Stay warm, happy holidays, and keep building! 🚀

## Confessions of a Code-First Creator (Who Isn't a Designer)

It might sound strange, but for me, putting creativity on digital paper—whether it's designing a website, painting, or drawing—has always been a struggle. Which is odd, because I consider myself a very creative person. That creativity shows up in all sorts of places: problem-solving software, coming up with clever workflows, or even my work as a sous chef, plating a dish. But something about UI/UX design? It just doesn't come naturally.

I don’t have formal design training or a background in art, and I suspect that’s part of the reason why it’s tough for me to know what will actually look good on a website. Still, I definitely see improvement every time I work on a new project, and that’s what matters. Progress, not perfection!


### Login & Register: Stealing with Pride

<img src="/newPortfolio/images/gallery/loginregister.png" alt="Login/Register Logo" />

When it came time to design the login and registration screens, I realized I didn’t need to look any further than my own past work. I borrowed heavily from the layouts and user flows I’d built for MealMatch—there’s no shame in reusing your own tried-and-true solutions! It made the whole process much faster and let me focus on refining the user experience instead of reinventing basic forms.

I tweaked the color scheme and spacing to fit the MyFinance brand, but many components—like labeled input fields, feedback messages, and the clean, central card layout—came straight from my previous designs. Adapting what worked well in MealMatch gave me a solid foundation and a little boost of confidence, too. Sometimes the smartest move is to steal from yourself.

---

### Dashboard: Where It Starts Feeling Real

<img src="/newPortfolio/images/gallery/dashboard.png" alt="Login/Register Logo" />


After a couple hours of sketching and tweaking, I had my Dashboard page laid out and surprisingly… I liked the result! Here's the setup:

- Logo stays anchored in the top left—because hey, brand consistency matters!
- Page header reminds you where you are.
- Welcoming message with a splash of color ("Welcome to MyFinance Dashboard. Congratulations, your colour is green so far this month!")—it's a tiny touch, but helps users feel seen and in control.

On the left, a sidebar for navigation. The main area holds three bubble containers with key data stats and listings. I chose a palette of crisp white with soft, light blue accents for the background. It adds clarity and clear separation without straining the eyes, even for longer reading or data review sessions.

I plan to use these bubbles throughout the app—consistency makes life easier, and creating reusable components isn’t just smart for devs, it’s a win for design too.


---

### The Pie Chart Challenge

Of course, it's not all smooth sailing. Building a pie chart that visually breaks down the data by category, with colors that mean something and look good, is going to be a real challenge—especially as a code-first person. But I'm up for it. Backend-to-frontend data connection will push me a bit outside my comfort zone, but that's the part that excites me most.

---

### What I've Learned So Far

- Not being a designer doesn’t mean you can’t design—just expect to iterate more.
- Borrowing trusted layouts and patterns is totally okay, especially for forms.
- Pick a color scheme you love early on, and use it as much as possible. Your app will feel more cohesive.
- Reusable components save you headaches down the line.
- Tackling the hardest parts (architecture and data flow) before visuals makes UI decisions easier.

---

### Next Steps

There’s still plenty to build: sidebar sections, adding more data containers, and thinking through the rest of the workflow screens. But with the dashboard and auth pages done, things are starting to click into place. 

After these steps, I’ll finally be able to start writing some code and wiring up the real data. That’s the fun part I’ve been waiting for!

---

### Parting Thoughts

Design is always going to challenge me, but that's half the reason I wanted to build MyFinance in the first place—creating something that solves a problem I care about, and learning new tech skills in the process. Each step, even the awkward, uncertain design moments, is progress. If you want to follow along with the build, or have advice on making pie charts prettier, I’d love to hear from you!

Thanks for reading—and have an awesome day!

## Progress Update: Conquering Frontend Fears 🚀

As I mentioned before, frontend design has always felt a bit daunting for me. But this time around, working on MyFinance, I surprised myself—I’m genuinely happy with how things turned out. It’s rewarding to see real progress, and it’s proof that with time and iteration, you can absolutely improve your design skills, even if you don’t consider yourself a “designer.” Still, I have to admit, I’m excited to dive back into the code!

### Why I Didn’t Skip the Design Step

In past projects, I’ve been tempted to rush straight into development, putting off the visuals for later. This time, I forced myself to slow down and take the design process seriously, because:

- **Most critical decisions happen here:** From how data should be structured, to what fields are actually needed, right down to choosing button styles and color palettes.
- **Better design = better schemas:** Laying out the UI made me revisit and finalize all my schema fields. Even though I started with a rough MVP schema, working on the screens showed me gaps and refinements I wouldn’t have spotted otherwise.
- **Iterating visually fuels better workflows:** Letting the design evolve alongside my data flow helped make the whole app more cohesive—not just in how it looks, but in how it works under the hood.

---

<img src="/newPortfolio/images/gallery/outcome-income.png" alt="Incomes and Outcomes pages screenshot" />

---

### What’s Ready So Far

- **Incomes and Outcomes pages:**  
  Clean, organized, and user-friendly. I spent extra effort making sure users always know where to find their data and how to interact with it—no more confusion or clutter.
- **Clear component structure:**  
  Each component is responsible for a single piece of data or UI, making the pages easy to read and navigate.
- **Dynamic modals:**  
  - Edit categories (for customizing how you see your finances)
  - Edit entries (for both payments and earnings)
- **Sidebar and side components:**  
  For seamless navigation and contextual data views.
- **Live data graph:**  
  A visual snapshot of current financial status, always up to date.
- **Reusability:**  
  All of this is built from just five small, modular, and reusable components, keeping things maintainable as the project grows.

---

<img src="/newPortfolio/images/gallery/components.png" alt="Reusable Components" />

---

### The New Challenge: Investments Page

Up next: tackling the Investments page!  
This area is a bit more complex—there’s a lot of data to surface and plenty of details to get right. Here’s my plan:

- **Map out all possible fields and relationships** for investments (assets, returns, performance over time, etc)
- **Design flexible UI components** that can handle a variety of investment types and summary stats
- **Keep the data highly readable and well separated** so users never feel overwhelmed
- **Develop the backend logic** to support robust data aggregation and reporting

It’s honestly exciting to see how much more there is to consider when the content is “money.” Compared to my previous project, MealMatch (which was a lot lighter on data), MyFinance is proving to be a fulfilling, challenging next step.

---

### What I’ve Learned (So Far)

- **Don’t fear the design phase:** The more effort I put into it, the fewer issues I have during development.
- **Schema-first doesn’t always mean UI-second:** Letting UI and data design evolve together makes for a more intuitive app.
- **Bite-sized reusable components = clear code and clean layouts.**
- **Good data flow planning pays off—** especially with complex domains like finance.
- **Expect surprises:** As soon as you work with real (or realistic) data, new requirements always surface!

---

### Wrapping Up

Thanks for following along—it means a lot. There’s still a long way to go, but seeing these pages come together (and learning so much in the process) has made the challenge completely worth it. I’m eager to finish the Investments page and then confront the backend complexities head-on.

If you have any feedback, suggestions, or just want to talk about building finance apps (or design struggles!), drop me a message or a comment below. And if you’re interested in a deeper dive, I’ve written an article about this very journey on my blog—check it out! I’d love your thoughts.

Stay warm, and have a fantastic holiday season! 🎄

## Why Build MyFinance?

A couple weeks ago, after launching my new portfolio website, I shared that I’d be starting a project that genuinely excites me. This is it: MyFinance.

Why am I so hyped about this one? Because for the first time, I’m building a solution for a real-world problem that I actually face every month. I’ve tried a bunch of finance apps, but most are either paid, overloaded with features I don’t need, or simply don’t fit the way I want to track things. I wanted something simple: to track my monthly income and expenses and keep my investments tidy—all in one dashboard. 

So, I decided to build my own tailored solution. And yes, MyFinance will be completely free!

---

## Defining the Project Scope & Goals

**Project name:** MyFinance

**The goal:** Let users (including myself!) easily track income, expenses, and investments with custom categories, see profit or loss each month, and export statements as neat PDFs.

**MVP Features:**  
- Personal sign up & login for privacy  
- Default and custom categories for income/expenses  
- Add/edit income and expense entries  
- Track investments (profit/loss per asset)  
- Monthly summary & one-click PDF exports

**Out of scope (for now):**  
- Bank integrations  
- Cross-account transfers  
- Net worth tracking  
- Mobile app  
- Payments/subscriptions

---

## Planning Data Flow & Architecture

I spent a fair bit of time sketching out the data models and relationships before writing any code. Here’s what I decided on:

**Core entities:**  
- **User:** Your personal account and settings  
- **Category:** "Groceries", "Salary", etc.—for grouping transactions  
- **Transaction:** Any income or expense entry  
- **Investment:** Profit/loss for assets you hold  
- **MonthlySnapshot (optional):** For caching monthly summaries

**Example data models:**

```json
// User
{ "username": "kedycat", "currency": "USD" }

// Category
{ "title": "Groceries", "type": "expense" }

// Transaction
{ "categoryId": "...", "type": "expense", "amount": 380000, "date": "..." }

// Investment
{ "asset": "BTC", "resultType": "profit", "resultAmount": 5000 }
```

- Transactions are linked to categories (many-to-one)
- Investments linked to users

---

## Aggregation & Reporting

One of the things I wanted most was a clear, one-glance monthly report showing income, expenses, investments, and overall profit.

I’m leveraging MongoDB’s aggregation to crunch the numbers for monthly reports:

- Sum up monthly income and expenses
- Sum profits (or losses) from investments
- Compute overall profit:

`profit = incomeTotal + investmentTotal - expenseTotal`

**API sample response:**

```json
{
  "incomeTotal": 450000,
  "expenseTotal": 350000,
  "investmentTotal": 50000,
  "profit": 150000
}
```

---

## API & UI Design

To keep things neat and user-friendly:

- **API Endpoints:** signup/login, CRUD for categories, transactions, investments, monthly reporting with PDF export
- **UI:** A dashboard with charts, easy category management, quick data entry via modals, and one-click PDF downloads

---

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (React UI & API routes)
- **TypeScript**
- **MongoDB**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- PDF export support via **Puppeteer** (or another server-side PDF lib)

---

## What’s Next?

Development has begun, and I’ll be sharing updates on how the build goes, and posting project learnings, cool solutions, and perhaps even some pain points here in the blog. If tracking your finances in your own way sounds interesting, stay tuned!

Thanks for reading—and wish me luck building MyFinance!

## About

Welcome to my new portfolio! I built this site using the Magic Portfolio template by Once UI, powered by Next.js. It’s MDX-based, SEO-friendly, responsive for any screen, and easily customizable.

I wanted a platform to showcase my work, projects, and blog posts — and I found this setup perfect for developers who want both flexibility and polish.

## Why I Chose This Stack

I wanted to learn a new framework not just by following tutorials, but by diving in and building something real from scratch. Hands-on experience always helps me understand and retain new skills better.

After some research, I picked these tools for my portfolio:

- **Next.js** — a modern React framework that makes routing, deployment, and performance optimization much easier out of the box.
- **MDX** — lets me write content in Markdown while also embedding React components, so my blog can be interactive and developer-friendly.
- **Once UI / Magic Portfolio** — provides a beautiful, ready-to-go theme with professional design, so I can focus my time on learning and content rather than building a design system from scratch.

## Quick Start

Thinking of starting your own? Here’s how I did it:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "git clone https://github.com/once-ui-system/magic-portfolio.git",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

Install the dependencies:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "npm install",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

Start your local dev server:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "npm run dev",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

## What’s Next?

I’ll be sharing more about my journey, tech experiments, and projects here. Stay tuned for posts on web development, the MERN stack, and full-stack best practices!
