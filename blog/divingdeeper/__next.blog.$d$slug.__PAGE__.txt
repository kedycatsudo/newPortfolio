## Frontend Design Wrapped 🎉 — MyFinance Dev Update

I can hardly believe it’s only been 12 days since I started building MyFinance. (To be honest, it felt even longer for how much I processed in those days. The result? I really like where it landed MyFinance holds way more information and complexity compared to MealMatch, and I’ll get into why!)

![MyFinance Logo](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/myfinancelogo.png)

---

### Starting with System Design

Before touching Figma, I mapped out backend schemas, data tables, data flows… basically all the structure from the ground up. As I moved into frontend design, some of those choices needed realignment—which just proves how closely backend and frontend play together. That’s what makes me proud to call myself a full stack developer now; I enjoy shaping both and seeing how each informs the other. Watching the logic (“bones”) and the interface (“skin”) come together, evolving in sync, is deeply satisfying—especially when it all just starts to make sense for this app’s unique needs.

![Puzzle Logo](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/puzzle.jpg)

---

### The Evolution (What I Had vs. What I Changed)

Page by page, my design instincts grew. I kept asking myself: what do I really need to see (not just what would be “cool”)? I focused on showing crisp separations between information blocks—this is a data-driven app, after all, with not much imagery or fluff. Each block needed clear segmenting, so data is readable (and, dare I say, a little inviting?). By the final screen, I noticed I’d developed a consistent style for lists, inputs, and modals—so I looped back and updated the earlier pages for a unified MVP look.

---

### The Finished Design (So Far)

Here’s the current lineup of 5 main pages (and what changed):

- **Login/Register**  
  Totally refreshed with new input styles and containers. These now fit the background narrative and feel much more futuristic—so good, they’re almost “fun” to fill out!
  
  ![Login/Register](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/loginregister.png)

- **Dashboard**  
  Updated data blocks with my current design language. I plopped in new "side" blocks that display investments and miscellaneous spending for the current month—turns out, these were just what the page needed. Recent incomings and outgoings show up in up-to-date tables.
  
  ![Dashboard](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/dashboard.png)

- **Incomes/Outcomes**  
  These pages are basically the birthplace of the new style. At first, the content was there, but it looked bland. With a new component system and better background, both pages are way cleaner and actually nice to look at, no matter how much data you throw at them.  
  ![Income/Outcome](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/incomesoutcomes.png)

- **Investment**  
  Here’s where things got really interesting. There’s a LOT more relevant data to surface than I first thought—assets, profit/loss, types, and more. I intentionally kept the scope tight so I wouldn’t overbuild, but re-used small components for new types of info. It’s also where I realized the importance of relational data: investments link to assets, returns, and user activity in ways a pure document database can’t easily handle. I started out building with MongoDB, but the deeper I went, the clearer it became—this project’s structure begs for a relational database. I’m now researching my options:  
    - **PostgreSQL:** Handles relationships, powerful queries, open source, huge community.  
    - **MySQL:** Mature, widespread, great performance, but not as flexible for JSON or modern types.  
    - **Supabase:** Postgres-based with instant APIs/auth, but still a bit new for mission-critical stuff.  

  I haven’t picked one yet, but diving into relational DBs makes this project even more valuable for me—I’m learning Next.js and TypeScript, then adding serious SQL design to my stack!

  ![Investment](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/investment.png)

- **Profile**  
  The simplest page, showing only what I need from the user: username, email (for auth/comms), the reset date for their monthly statement, and base currency for future features.

  ![Profile](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/profile.png)

---

- **Modals for Editing Data:**  
  There’s one main modal for editing, but it’s super reusable—swapping content as needed from page to page, styled for clarity and easy option selection or confirmation.

- **A Bunch of Small, Reusable Components:**  
  Core to keeping things DRY and maintainable.  
  ![Components](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/component.png)

- **Custom Buttons and Input Fields:**  
  Unified style, with color feedback and clear affordances everywhere.

---

In all honesty, designing for the large screen is now DONE—the structure is locked in, and every part fits just right. All that’s left is implementation, testing, and deployment. It feels wild to write that!

---

### What’s Next?

Much as I’d love to skip it, there’s no shipping a web app in 2025 that isn’t responsive. So mobile-first and tablet designs are next on my list. Once that's in place, I can finally dive deep into the codebase, start plugging in data, and let the real logic shine. I’m actually looking forward to untangling backend aggregates and complex queries with my new relational DB setup!

---

Thanks so much for following along—every message and bit of feedback motivates me more! Stay tuned for mobile layouts and backend tales soon, and as always, I’d love to hear your thoughts or suggestions.

## Progress Update: Conquering Frontend Fears 🚀

As I mentioned before, frontend design has always felt a bit daunting for me. But this time around, working on MyFinance, I surprised myself—I’m genuinely happy with how things turned out. It’s rewarding to see real progress, and it’s proof that with time and iteration, you can absolutely improve your design skills, even if you don’t consider yourself a “designer.” Still, I have to admit, I’m excited to dive back into the code!

### Why I Didn’t Skip the Design Step

In past projects, I’ve been tempted to rush straight into development, putting off the visuals for later. This time, I forced myself to slow down and take the design process seriously, because:

- **Most critical decisions happen here:** From how data should be structured, to what fields are actually needed, right down to choosing button styles and color palettes.
- **Better design = better schemas:** Laying out the UI made me revisit and finalize all my schema fields. Even though I started with a rough MVP schema, working on the screens showed me gaps and refinements I wouldn’t have spotted otherwise.
- **Iterating visually fuels better workflows:** Letting the design evolve alongside my data flow helped make the whole app more cohesive—not just in how it looks, but in how it works under the hood.

### What’s Ready So Far

- **Incomes and Outcomes pages:**  
  Clean, organized, and user-friendly. I spent extra effort making sure users always know where to find their data and how to interact with it—no more confusion or clutter.
- **Clear component structure:**  
  Each component is responsible for a single piece of data or UI, making the pages easy to read and navigate.
- **Dynamic modals:**  
  - Edit categories (for customizing how you see your finances)
  - Edit entries (for both payments and earnings)
- **Sidebar and side components:**  
  For seamless navigation and contextual data views.
- **Live data graph:**  
  A visual snapshot of current financial status, always up to date.
- **Reusability:**  
  All of this is built from just five small, modular, and reusable components, keeping things maintainable as the project grows.

### The New Challenge: Investments Page

Up next: tackling the Investments page!  
This area is a bit more complex—there’s a lot of data to surface and plenty of details to get right. Here’s my plan:

- **Map out all possible fields and relationships** for investments (assets, returns, performance over time, etc)
- **Design flexible UI components** that can handle a variety of investment types and summary stats
- **Keep the data highly readable and well separated** so users never feel overwhelmed
- **Develop the backend logic** to support robust data aggregation and reporting

It’s honestly exciting to see how much more there is to consider when the content is “money.” Compared to my previous project, MealMatch (which was a lot lighter on data), MyFinance is proving to be a fulfilling, challenging next step.

### What I’ve Learned (So Far)

- **Don’t fear the design phase:** The more effort I put into it, the fewer issues I have during development.
- **Schema-first doesn’t always mean UI-second:** Letting UI and data design evolve together makes for a more intuitive app.
- **Bite-sized reusable components = clear code and clean layouts.**
- **Good data flow planning pays off—** especially with complex domains like finance.
- **Expect surprises:** As soon as you work with real (or realistic) data, new requirements always surface!

### Wrapping Up

Thanks for following along—it means a lot. There’s still a long way to go, but seeing these pages come together (and learning so much in the process) has made the challenge completely worth it. I’m eager to finish the Investments page and then confront the backend complexities head-on.

If you have any feedback, suggestions, or just want to talk about building finance apps (or design struggles!), drop me a message or a comment below. And if you’re interested in a deeper dive, I’ve written an article about this very journey on my blog—check it out! I’d love your thoughts.

Stay warm, and have a fantastic holiday season! 🎄
