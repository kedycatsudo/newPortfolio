## Confessions of a Code-First Creator (Who Isn't a Designer)

It might sound strange, but for me, putting creativity on digital paper—whether it's designing a website, painting, or drawing—has always been a struggle. Which is odd, because I consider myself a very creative person. That creativity shows up in all sorts of places: problem-solving software, coming up with clever workflows, or even my work as a sous chef, plating a dish. But something about UI/UX design? It just doesn't come naturally.

I don’t have formal design training or a background in art, and I suspect that’s part of the reason why it’s tough for me to know what will actually look good on a website. Still, I definitely see improvement every time I work on a new project, and that’s what matters. Progress, not perfection!


### Login & Register: Stealing with Pride

<img src="/newPortfolio/images/gallery/loginregister.png" alt="Login/Register Logo" />

When it came time to design the login and registration screens, I realized I didn’t need to look any further than my own past work. I borrowed heavily from the layouts and user flows I’d built for MealMatch—there’s no shame in reusing your own tried-and-true solutions! It made the whole process much faster and let me focus on refining the user experience instead of reinventing basic forms.

I tweaked the color scheme and spacing to fit the MyFinance brand, but many components—like labeled input fields, feedback messages, and the clean, central card layout—came straight from my previous designs. Adapting what worked well in MealMatch gave me a solid foundation and a little boost of confidence, too. Sometimes the smartest move is to steal from yourself.

---

### Dashboard: Where It Starts Feeling Real

<img src="/newPortfolio/images/gallery/dashboard.png" alt="Login/Register Logo" />


After a couple hours of sketching and tweaking, I had my Dashboard page laid out and surprisingly… I liked the result! Here's the setup:

- Logo stays anchored in the top left—because hey, brand consistency matters!
- Page header reminds you where you are.
- Welcoming message with a splash of color ("Welcome to MyFinance Dashboard. Congratulations, your colour is green so far this month!")—it's a tiny touch, but helps users feel seen and in control.

On the left, a sidebar for navigation. The main area holds three bubble containers with key data stats and listings. I chose a palette of crisp white with soft, light blue accents for the background. It adds clarity and clear separation without straining the eyes, even for longer reading or data review sessions.

I plan to use these bubbles throughout the app—consistency makes life easier, and creating reusable components isn’t just smart for devs, it’s a win for design too.


---

### The Pie Chart Challenge

Of course, it's not all smooth sailing. Building a pie chart that visually breaks down the data by category, with colors that mean something and look good, is going to be a real challenge—especially as a code-first person. But I'm up for it. Backend-to-frontend data connection will push me a bit outside my comfort zone, but that's the part that excites me most.

---

### What I've Learned So Far

- Not being a designer doesn’t mean you can’t design—just expect to iterate more.
- Borrowing trusted layouts and patterns is totally okay, especially for forms.
- Pick a color scheme you love early on, and use it as much as possible. Your app will feel more cohesive.
- Reusable components save you headaches down the line.
- Tackling the hardest parts (architecture and data flow) before visuals makes UI decisions easier.

---

### Next Steps

There’s still plenty to build: sidebar sections, adding more data containers, and thinking through the rest of the workflow screens. But with the dashboard and auth pages done, things are starting to click into place. 

After these steps, I’ll finally be able to start writing some code and wiring up the real data. That’s the fun part I’ve been waiting for!

---

### Parting Thoughts

Design is always going to challenge me, but that's half the reason I wanted to build MyFinance in the first place—creating something that solves a problem I care about, and learning new tech skills in the process. Each step, even the awkward, uncertain design moments, is progress. If you want to follow along with the build, or have advice on making pie charts prettier, I’d love to hear from you!

Thanks for reading—and have an awesome day!

## Why Build MyFinance?

A couple weeks ago, after launching my new portfolio website, I shared that I’d be starting a project that genuinely excites me. This is it: MyFinance.

Why am I so hyped about this one? Because for the first time, I’m building a solution for a real-world problem that I actually face every month. I’ve tried a bunch of finance apps, but most are either paid, overloaded with features I don’t need, or simply don’t fit the way I want to track things. I wanted something simple: to track my monthly income and expenses and keep my investments tidy—all in one dashboard. 

So, I decided to build my own tailored solution. And yes, MyFinance will be completely free!

---

## Defining the Project Scope & Goals

**Project name:** MyFinance

**The goal:** Let users (including myself!) easily track income, expenses, and investments with custom categories, see profit or loss each month, and export statements as neat PDFs.

**MVP Features:**  
- Personal sign up & login for privacy  
- Default and custom categories for income/expenses  
- Add/edit income and expense entries  
- Track investments (profit/loss per asset)  
- Monthly summary & one-click PDF exports

**Out of scope (for now):**  
- Bank integrations  
- Cross-account transfers  
- Net worth tracking  
- Mobile app  
- Payments/subscriptions

---

## Planning Data Flow & Architecture

I spent a fair bit of time sketching out the data models and relationships before writing any code. Here’s what I decided on:

**Core entities:**  
- **User:** Your personal account and settings  
- **Category:** "Groceries", "Salary", etc.—for grouping transactions  
- **Transaction:** Any income or expense entry  
- **Investment:** Profit/loss for assets you hold  
- **MonthlySnapshot (optional):** For caching monthly summaries

**Example data models:**

```json
// User
{ "username": "kedycat", "currency": "USD" }

// Category
{ "title": "Groceries", "type": "expense" }

// Transaction
{ "categoryId": "...", "type": "expense", "amount": 380000, "date": "..." }

// Investment
{ "asset": "BTC", "resultType": "profit", "resultAmount": 5000 }
```

- Transactions are linked to categories (many-to-one)
- Investments linked to users

---

## Aggregation & Reporting

One of the things I wanted most was a clear, one-glance monthly report showing income, expenses, investments, and overall profit.

I’m leveraging MongoDB’s aggregation to crunch the numbers for monthly reports:

- Sum up monthly income and expenses
- Sum profits (or losses) from investments
- Compute overall profit:

`profit = incomeTotal + investmentTotal - expenseTotal`

**API sample response:**

```json
{
  "incomeTotal": 450000,
  "expenseTotal": 350000,
  "investmentTotal": 50000,
  "profit": 150000
}
```

---

## API & UI Design

To keep things neat and user-friendly:

- **API Endpoints:** signup/login, CRUD for categories, transactions, investments, monthly reporting with PDF export
- **UI:** A dashboard with charts, easy category management, quick data entry via modals, and one-click PDF downloads

---

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (React UI & API routes)
- **TypeScript**
- **MongoDB**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- PDF export support via **Puppeteer** (or another server-side PDF lib)

---

## What’s Next?

Development has begun, and I’ll be sharing updates on how the build goes, and posting project learnings, cool solutions, and perhaps even some pain points here in the blog. If tracking your finances in your own way sounds interesting, stay tuned!

Thanks for reading—and wish me luck building MyFinance!
