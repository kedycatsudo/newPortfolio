## About

Welcome to my new portfolio! I built this site using the Magic Portfolio template by Once UI, powered by Next.js. It’s MDX-based, SEO-friendly, responsive for any screen, and easily customizable.

I wanted a platform to showcase my work, projects, and blog posts — and I found this setup perfect for developers who want both flexibility and polish.

## Why I Chose This Stack

I wanted to learn a new framework not just by following tutorials, but by diving in and building something real from scratch. Hands-on experience always helps me understand and retain new skills better.

After some research, I picked these tools for my portfolio:

- **Next.js** — a modern React framework that makes routing, deployment, and performance optimization much easier out of the box.
- **MDX** — lets me write content in Markdown while also embedding React components, so my blog can be interactive and developer-friendly.
- **Once UI / Magic Portfolio** — provides a beautiful, ready-to-go theme with professional design, so I can focus my time on learning and content rather than building a design system from scratch.

## Quick Start

Thinking of starting your own? Here’s how I did it:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "git clone https://github.com/once-ui-system/magic-portfolio.git",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

Install the dependencies:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "npm install",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

Start your local dev server:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "npm run dev",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

## What’s Next?

I’ll be sharing more about my journey, tech experiments, and projects here. Stay tuned for posts on web development, the MERN stack, and full-stack best practices!
