# I Was the Customer: The Full-Stack Journey of Building MyFinance

I can't tell you how much I enjoyed working on this project. It was a remarkable learning experience and a hands-on opportunity to dive into new technologies like Tailwind CSS, Next.js, and TypeScript.

I also had the chance to work with different branches and manage them just like in a real-world project. Honestly, I’m proud—not just because the MVP is finished, but also because:

- I was the designer (and you can probably tell, hahah! I mentioned in a previous article that I’m not a designer, but I actually like how it turned out).
- I was the system architect.
- I was the junior dev.
- I was the senior dev.
- I was the project manager.
- I was the QA tester.
- More importantly, I **WAS THE CUSTOMER**.

You might wonder why I wrote "I WAS THE CUSTOMER" in all caps. To explain that, we need to roll all the way back to where it started—how I decided to build this project. Stay with me, just read and enjoy.

## How Did Everything Start?

It was a couple of months ago. I had just finished my new portfolio website and was considering my next move:

- Do another personal portfolio project, or  
- Start job hunting

I thought long and hard about those two options—listing pros, cons, and possible consequences. And I decided to create another project **before** I started job hunting.

### Why?

I really wanted to make this career transition as soon as possible, but I realized I actually wasn’t ready. The roles I’m aiming for are backend-heavy, but I didn’t have real hands-on experience with relational databases. I had worked with MongoDB, but that’s non-relational. And I know for sure that the companies I’m targeting—even for junior backend roles—are going to expect database experience.

That’s when I started thinking: what could I build with enough real data to create solid relational database tables?

It didn’t take me long to realize “money” is a *perfect* candidate. Think about it: almost everything in life involves money, so the data value is huge and the scope is broad.

This idea pushed me to look at what I actually needed to make my life easier. I started investigating what I was struggling to manage and keep track of. Because life is data, and if you don’t manage it, you lose it.

Everything came together: my big data is money, my demand is to track what my life needs—and the answer was right in front of me. A financial tracking application for myself.

Also, I’d been browsing tons of apps for personal finance management and never found one that fit my needs. On top of that—they weren’t even free?!  
Like, whaaat?!  
I’m an open source Linux software engineer. Don’t tell me I can’t get something I need if I don’t pay for it!

The name “MyFinance” immediately popped into my head. I loved it.

## Thinking Things Through—Before Even Creating the Repo

Think. Think. Think…

I knew my database would be PostgreSQL—no decision needed there.  
But what about the tech stack?

I wanted to add something new to my skill set: another framework, more useful tools, more data. I decided to go with Next.js and TypeScript. I’d just built my portfolio site with them, and I wanted to go even deeper.

Alright, I had the framework and database.  
What next?

Design!

I really didn’t want to use plain CSS, but I could learn a modern CSS system with new tech and still stick to the project’s purpose. So, I picked Tailwind CSS.

Here’s the final stack:
- **Design:** Tailwind CSS
- **Frontend framework:** Next.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Prisma)
- **Backend:** Nest.js—yet another framework I wanted to learn, and it works brilliantly with PostgreSQL and Prisma.

## Stack Ready. What Next?

On my last project, I started with the UI and moved to the backend later, only to find I had to completely rewire a ton of frontend logic to match the backend design. That was painful. This time, I’d heard that designing the backend system upfront saves a ton of time, so I decided to work out the data architecture *before* touching UI.

## System Design: Two Weeks with Nothing but a Blank Txt File

Just me and an empty text file.

I thought, and thought, some more. Writing down every idea, every question, every possible scenario. Categorized, analyzed, picked apart: Why? Where? How will I get that data?  
- What are my backbones?
- How does data flow?
- Decisions, buttons, forms, JSON files, file architecture, dead ends, loops, mappings, contexts, users… you name it.
I ended up with eight files, and reread them countless times—until there was nothing more to process. I needed some UI!

## Figuring Out the UI in Figma

This was my least favorite part. I’m definitely **not** a designer. Not because their job is less important—if anything, it’s the opposite! It’d be disrespectful for me to claim “I can design.” But, just for fun, here are a few snapshots from my Figma, and then we’ll compare them with the MVP.

## Finally, VS Code!

I finally fired up VS Code, created the repo, and just started writing.

Page by page, then refactoring, then components, and another round of refactoring. I remembered all those backend rewrites from my last project, but this time, frontend changes came much easier—thanks to building with the data flow in mind.

I created contexts, helpers, layouts—slowly piecing everything together.

## Unexpected Technical Issue

Remember, I said I wore every hat, including junior dev? Here’s proof:

A week ago, I was trying to publish an article for my blog. Instead of running `sudo rm -r ./*`, I wrote `sudo rm -r /*`.  
*Yeah.*  
The feeling when you realize files are disappearing from **root** is hard to describe. I jumped for ctrl+c, but it was too late. The damage was done.

My laptop got weird, slowed down, then went dark. I couldn’t even see the console screen, so no way to recover anything.

Remember, I was the senior dev too? So, I did what a senior dev does—reinstalled Linux, everything gone. Silence.

But I’d pushed my repos and branches just before. Cold-blooded, methodical, no shaking hands. Mad, maybe! But head down, job to do.

Did I mention I love Kobe Bryant? His ambition and will to win—incredible. That’s what I try to channel: the Black Mamba mentality. I win. That’s my job.

Pulled my repos, checked every branch, blog, project. Everything was there. Back on track.

I love staying static. Like Ice Age—no emotion. Maybe I picked that up working as a chef, spending six hours serving customers, knowing there’s four more to go. You put your head down. You finish the job.

## And the Last Touches

.env file set up for `assetPrefix` and `basePath`—super useful for Next.js and GitHub Pages.  
And just like that: published! MyFinance MVP is live on GitHub Pages. If you’re interested, here’s the link: [link]

## What I have on my hand now. Lets compare with the deisgn that i made

![MVP 6](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/myfinance6.png)
![MVP 7](/newPortfolio/images/gallery/myfinance7.png)


## What’s Next?

More learning, more databases. I’ll move to PostgreSQL and Prisma on the backend, and integrate them into this project. Lots of late nights and snow where I live—stay warm, stay safe, and I’ll see you in the next one.
