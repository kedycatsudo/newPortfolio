## Confessions of a Code-First Creator (Who Isn't a Designer)

It might sound strange, but for me, putting creativity on digital paper—whether it's designing a website, painting, or drawing—has always been a struggle. Which is odd, because I consider myself a very creative person. That creativity shows up in all sorts of places: problem-solving software, coming up with clever workflows, or even my work as a sous chef, plating a dish. But something about UI/UX design? It just doesn't come naturally.

I don’t have formal design training or a background in art, and I suspect that’s part of the reason why it’s tough for me to know what will actually look good on a website. Still, I definitely see improvement every time I work on a new project, and that’s what matters. Progress, not perfection!

### Dashboard: Where It Starts Feeling Real

After a couple hours of sketching and tweaking, I had my Dashboard page laid out and surprisingly… I liked the result! Here's the setup:

- Logo stays anchored in the top left—because hey, brand consistency matters!
- Page header reminds you where you are.
- Welcoming message with a splash of color ("Welcome to MyFinance Dashboard. Congratulations, your colour is green so far this month!")—it's a tiny touch, but helps users feel seen and in control.

On the left, a sidebar for navigation. The main area holds three bubble containers with key data stats and listings. I chose a palette of crisp white with soft, light blue accents for the background. It adds clarity and clear separation without straining the eyes, even for longer reading or data review sessions.

I plan to use these bubbles throughout the app—consistency makes life easier, and creating reusable components isn’t just smart for devs, it’s a win for design too.

### The Pie Chart Challenge

Of course, it's not all smooth sailing. Building a pie chart that visually breaks down the data by category, with colors that mean something and look good, is going to be a real challenge—especially as a code-first person. But I'm up for it. Backend-to-frontend data connection will push me a bit outside my comfort zone, but that's the part that excites me most.

### What I've Learned So Far

- Not being a designer doesn’t mean you can’t design—just expect to iterate more.
- Borrowing trusted layouts and patterns is totally okay, especially for forms.
- Pick a color scheme you love early on, and use it as much as possible. Your app will feel more cohesive.
- Reusable components save you headaches down the line.
- Tackling the hardest parts (architecture and data flow) before visuals makes UI decisions easier.

### Next Steps

There’s still plenty to build: sidebar sections, adding more data containers, and thinking through the rest of the workflow screens. But with the dashboard and auth pages done, things are starting to click into place. 

After these steps, I’ll finally be able to start writing some code and wiring up the real data. That’s the fun part I’ve been waiting for!

### Parting Thoughts

Design is always going to challenge me, but that's half the reason I wanted to build MyFinance in the first place—creating something that solves a problem I care about, and learning new tech skills in the process. Each step, even the awkward, uncertain design moments, is progress. If you want to follow along with the build, or have advice on making pie charts prettier, I’d love to hear from you!

Thanks for reading—and have an awesome day!
