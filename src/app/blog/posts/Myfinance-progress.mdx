## Progress Update: Conquering Frontend Fears 🚀

As I mentioned before, frontend design has always felt a bit daunting for me. But this time around, working on MyFinance, I surprised myself—I’m genuinely happy with how things turned out. It’s rewarding to see real progress, and it’s proof that with time and iteration, you can absolutely improve your design skills, even if you don’t consider yourself a “designer.” Still, I have to admit, I’m excited to dive back into the code!

### Why I Didn’t Skip the Design Step

In past projects, I’ve been tempted to rush straight into development, putting off the visuals for later. This time, I forced myself to slow down and take the design process seriously, because:

- **Most critical decisions happen here:** From how data should be structured, to what fields are actually needed, right down to choosing button styles and color palettes.
- **Better design = better schemas:** Laying out the UI made me revisit and finalize all my schema fields. Even though I started with a rough MVP schema, working on the screens showed me gaps and refinements I wouldn’t have spotted otherwise.
- **Iterating visually fuels better workflows:** Letting the design evolve alongside my data flow helped make the whole app more cohesive—not just in how it looks, but in how it works under the hood.

### What’s Ready So Far

- **Incomes and Outcomes pages:**  
  Clean, organized, and user-friendly. I spent extra effort making sure users always know where to find their data and how to interact with it—no more confusion or clutter.
- **Clear component structure:**  
  Each component is responsible for a single piece of data or UI, making the pages easy to read and navigate.
- **Dynamic modals:**  
  - Edit categories (for customizing how you see your finances)
  - Edit entries (for both payments and earnings)
- **Sidebar and side components:**  
  For seamless navigation and contextual data views.
- **Live data graph:**  
  A visual snapshot of current financial status, always up to date.
- **Reusability:**  
  All of this is built from just five small, modular, and reusable components, keeping things maintainable as the project grows.

### The New Challenge: Investments Page

Up next: tackling the Investments page!  
This area is a bit more complex—there’s a lot of data to surface and plenty of details to get right. Here’s my plan:

- **Map out all possible fields and relationships** for investments (assets, returns, performance over time, etc)
- **Design flexible UI components** that can handle a variety of investment types and summary stats
- **Keep the data highly readable and well separated** so users never feel overwhelmed
- **Develop the backend logic** to support robust data aggregation and reporting

It’s honestly exciting to see how much more there is to consider when the content is “money.” Compared to my previous project, MealMatch (which was a lot lighter on data), MyFinance is proving to be a fulfilling, challenging next step.

### What I’ve Learned (So Far)

- **Don’t fear the design phase:** The more effort I put into it, the fewer issues I have during development.
- **Schema-first doesn’t always mean UI-second:** Letting UI and data design evolve together makes for a more intuitive app.
- **Bite-sized reusable components = clear code and clean layouts.**
- **Good data flow planning pays off—** especially with complex domains like finance.
- **Expect surprises:** As soon as you work with real (or realistic) data, new requirements always surface!

### Wrapping Up

Thanks for following along—it means a lot. There’s still a long way to go, but seeing these pages come together (and learning so much in the process) has made the challenge completely worth it. I’m eager to finish the Investments page and then confront the backend complexities head-on.

If you have any feedback, suggestions, or just want to talk about building finance apps (or design struggles!), drop me a message or a comment below. And if you’re interested in a deeper dive, I’ve written an article about this very journey on my blog—check it out! I’d love your thoughts.

Stay warm, and have a fantastic holiday season! 🎄
